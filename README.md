- Inside the Slime create all the Frames(Letter A) needed

## Week 02 **HTML** :pushpin:
- Started working with HTML, GIT and GitHub.
- First Step is dowload the apps we are going to need 
  > Note:[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) ``Choose your operating system and press "Click here to download"`` :speech_balloon:

  > Note:[VisualCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)`` There are many editors for HTML in this case we are going to use VisualCode`` :speech_balloon:

  > Note:[GitHub](https://github.com/)`` Here we have to register with an email and password`` :speech_balloon:

- Once downloaded the first thing we have to do is create a folder on the desktop
- Inside this folder we're going to create two files (index.html and README.md)
-We have to right click on the folder and select "Git Bash here" to initialize GIT

  > Note:[Basic Git commands](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html) :cinema:

- Once the files are created we drag the folder to VisualCode
- The next step is created a repository on GitHub and link it with git
